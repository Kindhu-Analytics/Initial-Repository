# 👋 Hey, I’m Kindhujan Mahendiran (aka Ghost)

I'm a logistics professional transitioning into the world of data, systems, and product leadership.  
I use SQL, dashboards, and Scrum principles to solve real-world problems and design smarter systems.

### 🔭 Current Focus
- Building dashboards with **Tableau Public** to visualize urban, personal, and financial data
- Learning **SQL**, **Agile Scrum**, and **workflow optimization** for tech teams
- Training in **public speaking**, **voice control**, and **fitness** — because confidence is both skill and posture

### 🧰 Tools I’m Using
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, BigQuery)
- **Tableau Public** (Free data dashboards)
- **Notion** for project + personal systems
- **GitHub** to show my work publicly

### 📁 Featured Projects
- 📊 [Toronto 311 Dashboard](#) — Visualizing service request patterns by district  
- 🚗 [407 ETR Cost Tracker](#) — Mapping usage spikes + cost over time  
- ✈️ [Airline Delay Analyzer](#) — Simulating delay trends from open flight data  

### 🎯 Mission
I’m not just learning — I’m documenting real skills through hands-on data projects  
so I can step into **high-value roles in tech, logistics, or product ops.**

Let's connect and build something real.
